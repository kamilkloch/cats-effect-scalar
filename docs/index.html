Hello, very happy to be here, in person not over a Zoom call
Also honored, to have this opportunity to talk to @Scalar - a very fine Scala event 
SoftwareMill is one of the bright stars on the Scala ecosystem 
I would like to start 
- used CE in our company (web backend)
- came across 'standard' industry questions
- struggled to find a solution
- CE and fs2 tight together
- we will (hopefully) solve the problems, but more importantly,
  look a bit under the hood of CE internals:
  - fibers
  - IOApp
  - IORuntime
  - structured concurrency
  - Local state
<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->
---
##Plan of the talk
1. Ask for 3 recipes 🍲
   - implement an imperative resource-safe web socket client
   - wrap asynchronous callbacks into an [fs2] Stream
   - enrich logging with (scoped) contextual data
--

2. Diverge into Cats-Effect internals:
   - fibers
   - structured concurrency
   - IORuntime
   - IOApp
   - local state
--

3. Propose 3 recipes using [Supervisor][supervisor], [Dispatcher][dispatcher] and [IOLocal][io-local]
<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->

##Cats Effect Recipes 🍲
<img src="img/cats-effect-recipes.jpg" width="100%">

- Propose an idea for a recipe: [issues/3439](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect/issues/3439)
- Write a recipe yourself! 💪 🍲

##Task 1:  Web Socket client
Implement a __resource-safe__ imperative client for:
  - sending data over a web socket connection
  - so that releasing the client resource also shuts down all the underlying connections

```scala
trait WebSocketClient { 
  def sendMessage(msg: String): IO[Unit]
}

val clientResource: Resource[IO, WebSocketClient] = ???

clientResource.use { client =>
  client.sendMessage("Hello, Scalar 2023!")
}
```

##Task 2: fs2 Stream from callbacks
Given a callback-based API:
  - enqueue the messages from the callbacks into an [fs2] stream
  - preserve the ordering of the messages
  - make it lightweight for the thread invoking the callbacks

???
this fs2 stream is actually the sending side of a web socket connection
--

```scala
abstract class CallbackAPI {
  `def onMessage(msg: String): Unit`
}

new CallbackAPI {
  override `def onMessage(msg: String): Unit` = {
    // enqueue the message into an fs2 Stream
    // preserve message ordering
    // do not congest the caller thread
  }
}
```
<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->
---
##Task 3: Contextual logging
Enrich log messages with contextual data (e.g. correlation id).  
(Think tracing, but in logs)

--

##Tasks - revisited.super[CE3]
1. Web socket client: how to manage the (non-standard) lifecycle of a [fiber]?
2. [fs2] Stream from callbacks: how to safely and efficiently run `IO` from within unsafe code?
3. Contextual logging: how to propagate data across a forked [fiber]?

???
1. non-standard - e.g. beyond the scope of a function

---
##Fibers
[Fibers][fiber] are *the* fundamental abstraction in Cats Effect. All effects in IO are executed by some fiber.

--


Compared to operating system threads, fibers:
 - are *very* lightweight (~150 bytes)
 - scale indefinitely (with memory being the limiting factor)
   - (performance may actually *increase* with the number of fibers!)
 - can be created and started extremely fast
 - are strongly typed
 - support asynchronous callbacks
 - can be safely, efficiently and reliably canceled at any point in time
   - cancelation can be suppressed within scoped regions
 - support resource handling
???

- managed by the application runtime - __semantic__ sequentiality, as opposed to __strict__ sequentiality in threads
- Threads are scarce — Threads on the JVM map to the operating system level threads - upper bound
- thread stop operation has been deprecated.
- context switching: from Daniel's talk - page faults account for 30% of total runtime of the application
- composability — not typed, no return type.

The asynchronous support in particular has profound effects, since it means that any individual "step" of a fiber
(much like a statement in a thread) may be either synchronous in that it runs until it produces a value or errors,
or asynchronous in that it registers a callback which may be externally invoked at some later point,
and there is no fundamental difference between these steps: they're just part of the fiber.
This means that it is just as easy to define business logic which weaves through asynchronous,
callback-oriented actions as it is to define the same logic in terms of classically blocking control flows.

resources gracefully released as early as possible within an application.
First off, is cooperative. When one fiber calls cancel on another fiber, it is effectively a request to the target fiber.
If the target fiber is unable to cancel at that moment for any reason, the canceling fiber asynchronously waits
for cancelation to become possible. Once cancelation starts, the target fiber will run all of its finalizers
(usually used to release resources such as file handles) before yielding control back to the canceler.
Conversely, interrupt always returns immediately, even if the target Thread has not actually been interrupted.

If a fiber is performing a series of actions which must be executed atomically (i.e. either all actions execute,
or none of them do), it can use the IO.uncancelable method to mask the cancelation signal within the scope,
ensuring that cancelation is deferred until the fiber has completed its critical section. This is commonly used
in conjunction with compound resource acquisition, where a scarce resource might leak if the fiber were to be canceled
"in the middle". This differs considerably from Thread#interrupt, which cannot be suppressed.

##Run your IOs from within IOApp 
IOApp is the primary entry point to a Cats Effect application
- takes care of properly setting up `IORuntime`
- optimizes for an application fully contained within the `run` method.
- sets up [starvation checking](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/core/starvation-and-tuning)
  and [fiber dumps](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/core/fiber-dumps)
- translates SIGTERM to IO cancelation - `.unsafeRun()` does not
- fatal exceptions more likely to be captured and logged before terminating
- handles  `run / fork := true` and `run / fork := false` in sbt

##Fibers are low-level 🧨
```scala
def ioNever = IO.never.as(1).onCancel(IO.println("canceled"))
def ioError = IO.raiseError(new Exception).as(1)

def fiberSum = for {
   f1 <- ioError.start
   f2 <- ioNever.start
   x <- f1.joinWithNever
   y <- f2.joinWithNever
} yield x + y

// 🧨🧨🧨 leaking fiber!
fiberSum.attempt.yolo()
// res1: Either[Throwable, Int] = Left(value = java.lang.Exception)

(ioError, ioNever).parMapN(_ + _).attempt.yolo()
// canceled
// res2: Either[Throwable, Int] = Left(value = java.lang.Exception)
```
<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->
---
##Structured Concurrency

Concurrency is [structured](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/concepts#structured-concurrency)
when the syntactic code structure bounds the lifetime of threads (fibers).
???
When new threads (fibers) are spawned within a syntactic block, we can be sure that
these threads (fibers) are terminated when executing the block ends.

With fibers, we can have hundreds of thousands and even millions of fibers that are started and working together.
So we can reach a very massive concurrency with fibers. Now how can we manage all these fibers? Some of them
are top-level fibers and some others are forked and become children of their parents. How can we manage their scopes,
how to keep track of all fibers, and prevent them to leak? What happens to the execution of a child fiber
if its parent execution is interrupted?
--

 - We can statically reason about the lifetimes of children fibers just by looking at the code.
 - We don't need to insert complicated logic to keep track of all the child fibers and manually shut them down.
--


Cats Effect *encourages* [structured concurrency](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/concepts#structured-concurrency),
provides a large number of flexible tools for achieving it, but it does not *prevent*
unstructured concurrent compositions such as `start`.
???
compare to ZIO: The way ZIO's structured concurrency works is that the child fibers are scoped to their parent fibers
which means that when the parent effect finishes execution, then all childs' effects will be automatically interrupted.

---
## Concurrency - high level combinators
Concurrently execute both effects, return the winner, cancel the loser
```scala
IO.race(IO(1), ioNever).yolo()
// canceled
// res3: Either[Int, Int] = Left(value = 1)
```
<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->
---
## Concurrency - high level combinators.super[2]
Concurrently execute all effects, collect all results,
if any effect being parallelized fails, cancel the rest

```scala
List(IO(1), IO(2)).parSequence.yolo()
// res4: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

List(ioNever, ioError).parSequence.attempt.yolo()
// canceled
// res5: Either[Throwable, List[Int]] = Left(value = java.lang.Exception)
```
<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->
---
##When `.parMapN` does not suffice
[Supervisor][supervisor] manages the lifecycle of all fibers that are started via its interface.
Enables to start a fiber in a *fire-and-forget* manner.

```scala
trait Supervisor {
  def supervise[A](fa: IO[A]): IO[Fiber[IO, Throwable, A]]
}
```
???
same signature as `Fiber#start`

Supervisor: fire-and-forget: "I can complete the current task regardless of the completion of the spawned task"

--

Creating a Supervisor:
```scala
object Supervisor {
  def apply(`await`: Boolean): Resource[IO, Supervisor[IO]]
}
```

- wait for all supervised fibers to complete, or
- cancel any remaining active fibers
???
The supervisor is managed by a singular fiber to which the lifecycles of all spawned fibers are bound.

Whereas cats.effect.kernel.GenSpawn.background links the lifecycle of the spawned fiber to the calling fiber,
starting a fiber via a Supervisor links the lifecycle of the spawned fiber to the supervisor fiber.
This is useful when the scope of some fiber must survive the spawner, but should still be confined within some "larger" scope.

##Dispatcher.super[2]
[Dispatcher][dispatcher] comes in two flavors:
 
- parallel - no guarantees on ordering of job execution
- sequential - strict (FIFO) ordering of submitted jobs

The lifecycle of spawned fibers is managed by [Supervisor][supervisor]

```scala
object Dispatcher {
  def parallel(`await: Boolean`): Resource[IO, Dispatcher[IO]]
  def sequential(`await: Boolean`): Resource[IO, Dispatcher[IO]]
}
```

---
##Dispatcher.parallel

Submit 2 jobs with no ordering guarantees, await the results:

```scala
Dispatcher.`parallel[IO](await = true)`.use { d =>
  d.unsafeRunAndForget(IO.print("Scalar 2023!!").`delayBy(5.millis)`)
  d.unsafeRunAndForget(IO.print("Hello "))
  
  IO.unit
}.yolo()
// Hello Scalar 2023!!
```
<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->
---
##Dispatcher.sequential
Submit 3 jobs with strict ordering guarantees, do not await the results,  
cancel outstanding jobs when Dispatcher shuts down:


```scala
Dispatcher.`sequential[IO](await = false)`.use { d =>
  d.unsafeRunAndForget(IO.print("Scalar 2023").delayBy(5.millis))
  d.unsafeRunAndForget(IO.println(" Hello!!"))
  
  d.unsafeRunAndForget(
    IO.print('*').delayBy(50.millis).onCancel(IO.print("Canceled"))
  )
  
  IO.unit.delayBy(10.millis)
}.yolo()
// Scalar 2023 Hello!!
// Canceled

##Dispatcher > `unsafeRun()`

- much safer - lifecycles are properly scoped (structured concurrency)
- more efficient: 
  - anything submitted to Dispatcher runs on the CE3 [compute pool][compute-pool],  
    as opposed to starting a new execution chain
  - `unsafeRun` will act as a relocation point for the target runtime 
    (usually global) when it encounters fatal errors in any evaluation
- Dispatcher propagates fatal errors back to the calling point
- cancelation results in: 
  - non-termination with Dispatcher
  - `CancellationException` with unsafeRun
    
???
Dispatcher is basically a handle into the existing runtime, whereas unsafeRun on IO
has to start an entirely new execution chain (with various associated costs and tradeoffs).

calling unsafeRun on IO basically creates a tiny little island within your application
even with a shared IORuntime between all of the runtime islands, the integration is not particularly tight
the implementation makes the assumption that these unsafeRun calls are relatively rare
and by making that assumption, we're able to improve on the safety and ergonomics of the whole system
(e.g. by propagating fatal errors back to the calling point)
using a Dispatcher, you aren't actually really running your IO[A], you're just connecting it to the other IO which was used to create the Dispatcher in the first place, and that IO will run yours
this is (surprisingly!) a much more efficient thing to do

##IOLocal
[IOLocal][io-local] allows to share context across the scope of a [Fiber][fiber]  

- fiber version of Java's ThreadLocal
- value bound to an executing fiber
- different fibers who hold the same `IOLocal[A]` can independently  
  set and retrieve its value, without collisions.

Run in parallel *n* fibers, put *cid* into logging context, log the context

##Contextual logging

```scala
lazy val log = Logger.takingImplicit[this.type, LoggingCtx]

def impure(implicit ctx: LoggingCtx): Unit = log.info("Impure")

def parCtxLog(n: Int) = (1 to n).toList.parTraverse_ { cid =>
    LoggingCtx.put("cid", cid.toString) >>
      LoggingCtx.use(implicit ctx => IO(log.info(s"$cid"))) }

(`LoggingCtx.withField("k1", "v1")`.use { implicit ctx =>
  impure
  parCtxLog(2) >> 
    LoggingCtx.use { ctx => IO(log.info("Scalar 2023")(ctx)) }
} >> 
  LoggingCtx.use(implicit ctx => IO(log.info("Empty")))).yolo()
```

Scoped context

<!-- &*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*  -->

##Contextual logging

```scala
lazy val log = Logger.takingImplicit[this.type, LoggingCtx]

def impure(implicit ctx: LoggingCtx): Unit = log.info("Impure")

def parCtxLog(n: Int) = (1 to n).toList.parTraverse_ { cid =>
    LoggingCtx.put("cid", cid.toString) >>
      LoggingCtx.use(implicit ctx => IO(log.info(s"$cid"))) }

(LoggingCtx.withField("k1", "v1").use { implicit ctx =>
  impure
* parCtxLog(2) >> 
*   LoggingCtx.use { ctx => IO(log.info("Scalar 2023")(ctx)) }
} >> 
  LoggingCtx.use(implicit ctx => IO(log.info("Empty")))).yolo()
```

Forked fibers do not back-propagate context to parent

    LoggingCtx.put("cid", cid.toString) >>
      LoggingCtx.use(implicit ctx => IO(log.info(s"$cid"))) }

(LoggingCtx.withField("k1", "v1").use { implicit ctx =>
